# Modular Robot Arm

<RobotScene />

The general form of the heat equation is:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u
$$

where:

- $u = u(x,t)$ represents the temperature distribution as a function of position $x$ and time $t$.
- $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity of the material, defined as $\alpha = \frac{k}{\rho c_p}$, where:
  - $k$ is the thermal conductivity,
  - $\rho$ is the density,
  - $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure.
- $\nabla^2$ is the Laplace operator, which in one-dimensional form is:

$$
\nabla^2 u = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$
