I gracefully struggled through this simulation during college in a controls course that ended up being one of my favorite classes. Controls theory and the possibilities we are able to achieve are fascinating. I want to give a quick shout out to the following public resource which was the principal material we studied in that class and where a lot of my code comes from. The github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/byu-controlbook/controlbook_public). I also want to shout out my professor Dr. Killpack who did a phenomenal job instilling a continous curiosity in engineering and especially in controls. Throughout this post I will assume you have some knowledge with **Euler-Lagrange Equations**, **Python**, **Linear Algebra** and **ODE's**.

The system above has two degrees of freedom, so our generalized coordinates will be: **$q_1 = \theta$ and $q_2 = z$**  
There are two bodies, so we'll have 2 equations of motion. Let's start by writing the position vectors to the center of mass of each body.

Modeling the pendulum as a slender arm (1) and the cart as a solid body (2) we get:

$$
\vec{r}_1 = (z + \frac{l}{2}\sin\theta)\hat{i} + \frac{l}{2}\cos\theta\hat{j}
$$

$$
\vec{r}_2 = z\hat{i}
$$

Take the derivative of both to get:

$$
\dot{\vec{r}_1} = (\dot{z} + \frac{l}{2}\dot{\theta}\cos\theta)\hat{i} - \frac{l}{2}\dot{\theta}\sin\theta\hat{j}
$$

$$
\dot{\vec{r}_2} = \dot{z}\hat{i}
$$

Cool, now there's a couple more things we need before writing down the total kinetic energy. Notice that the slender arm will also have an angular velocity defined by: $\vec{\omega}_1 = -\dot{\theta}\hat{k}$ and an inertia matrix of:

$$
I_{G_1} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{12} m_1 l^2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{12} m_1 l^2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Now we can get the total kinetic energy, which, in our case, is defined by the following:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} m_1 \dot{\vec{r}}_1 \cdot \dot{\vec{r}}_1 + \frac{1}{2} \vec{\omega}_1^\top I_{G_1} \vec{\omega}_1 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 \dot{\vec{r}}_2 \cdot \dot{\vec{r}}_2
$$

Click the dropdown below if you want to see the plugging and chugging. Otherwise, just trust me and skip ahead.

<Dropdown label="KE derivation">

$$
\dot{\vec{r}}_1 \cdot \dot{\vec{r}}_1 =
\left(\dot{z} + \frac{l}{2}\dot{\theta}\cos\theta\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{l}{2}\dot{\theta}\sin\theta\right)^2
$$

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} m_1 \left(\dot{z}^2 + l\dot{z} \dot{\theta} \cos\theta + \frac{l^2}{4} \dot{\theta}^2 \right) + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{12} m_1 l^2 \dot{\theta}^2 \right) + \frac{1}{2} m_2 \dot{z}^2
$$

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} m_1 \dot{z}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_1 l\dot{z} \dot{\theta} \cos\theta + \frac{1}{8} m_1 l^2 \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{24} m_1 l^2 \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 \dot{z}^2
$$

combine like terms to get

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) \dot{z}^2 + \frac{1}{6} m_1 l^2 \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_1 l\dot{z} \dot{\theta} \cos\theta
$$

    </div>

</Dropdown>

In the end, we get the following:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) \dot{z}^2 + \frac{1}{6} m_1 l^2 \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_1 l\dot{z} \dot{\theta} \cos\theta
$$
