## Introduction

I gracefully struggled through this simulation in a controls course that ended up being one of my favorite classes in college. Controls theory and the physical possibilities we are able to achieve are fascinating. I want to give a quick shout out to the following public resource which was the main material we studied in that class, and where a lot of my code comes from. The github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/byu-controlbook/controlbook_public). I also want to shout out my professor Dr. Killpack who did a phenomenal job instilling a continous curiosity in engineering and especially in controls.  
Throughout this post I will assume you have some knowledge with **Euler-Lagrange Equations**, **Python**, **Linear Algebra** and **ODE's**.

## First Steps

When we use Euler-Lagrange to determine the equations of motion for a given system, we have to start off by defining our generalized coordinates (degrees of freedom) and the number of bodies in our system. Here's a quick little svg of how I'm defining all the coordinates:

<InvertedPendulumSVG />

The system has two degrees of freedom, one for the angle of the bar and another for the horizontal position of the cart, so I'll define our generalized coordinates as such: **$q_1 = \theta$ and $q_2 = z$**  
There are two bodies, so we'll have 2 equations of motion. Let's kick things off by writing the position vectors to the center of mass of each body.

Modeling the pendulum as a slender arm (1) and the cart as a solid body (2) we get:

$$
\vec{r}_1 = (z + \frac{l}{2}\sin\theta)\hat{i} + \frac{l}{2}\cos\theta\hat{j}
$$

$$
\vec{r}_2 = z\hat{i}
$$

Take the derivative of both to get:

$$
\dot{\vec{r}_1} = (\dot{z} + \frac{l}{2}\dot{\theta}\cos\theta)\hat{i} - \frac{l}{2}\dot{\theta}\sin\theta\hat{j}
$$

$$
\dot{\vec{r}_2} = \dot{z}\hat{i}
$$

Cool, now there's a couple more things we need before writing down the total kinetic energy. Notice that the slender arm will also have an angular velocity defined by: $\vec{\omega}_1 = -\dot{\theta}\hat{k}$ , and an inertia matrix of:

$$
I_{G_1} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{12} m_1 l^2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{12} m_1 l^2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Now we can get the total kinetic energy, which, in our case, is defined by the following:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} m_1 \dot{\vec{r}}_1 \cdot \dot{\vec{r}}_1 + \frac{1}{2} \vec{\omega}_1^\top I_{G_1} \vec{\omega}_1 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 \dot{\vec{r}}_2 \cdot \dot{\vec{r}}_2
$$

    <div className="bg-primary/50 backdrop-blur-md border border-palette-1 rounded-md p-2">
compute the first dot product:
$$
\dot{\vec{r}}_1 \cdot \dot{\vec{r}}_1 =
\left(\dot{z} + \frac{l}{2}\dot{\theta}\cos\theta\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{l}{2}\dot{\theta}\sin\theta\right)^2
$$

$$
= \dot{z}^2 + l \dot{z} \dot{\theta} \cos\theta + \frac{l^2}{4} \dot{\theta}^2 \cos^2\theta + \frac{l^2}{4} \dot{\theta}^2 \sin^2\theta
$$

$$
= \dot{z}^2 + l \dot{z} \dot{\theta} \cos\theta + \frac{l^2}{4} \dot{\theta}^2
$$

now let's compute the omega and inertia matrix multiplication:

$$
\vec{\omega}_1^\top I_{G_1} \vec{\omega}_1 =
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -\dot{\theta} & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{12} m_1 l^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{12} m_1 l^2 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -\dot{\theta} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{12} m_1 l^2 \dot{\theta}^2
$$

Plug everything back in to the kinetic energy equation:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} m_1 \left( \dot{z}^2 + l \dot{z} \dot{\theta} \cos\theta + \frac{l^2}{4} \dot{\theta}^2 \right) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{12} m_1 l^2 \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 \dot{z}^2
$$

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} m_1 \dot{z}^2 + \frac{l}{2} m_1 \dot{z} \dot{\theta} \cos\theta + \frac{l^2}{8} m_1 \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{l^2}{24} m_1 \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 \dot{z}^2
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) \dot{z}^2 + \frac{l}{2} m_1 \dot{z} \dot{\theta} \cos\theta + \frac{l^2}{6} m_1 \dot{\theta}^2
$$

    </div>

In the end, we get the following:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) \dot{z}^2 + \frac{l^2}{6} m_1 \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{l}{2} m_1 \dot{z} \dot{\theta} \cos\theta
$$

Defining the initial potential energy at the center of the cart, our potential energy is given by the gravitational potential energy of the center of mass of the slender rod, which is:

$$
V = \frac{l}{2} m_1 g \cos\theta
$$

Now we can write out the Lagrangian $L = T - V$:

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) \dot{z}^2 + \frac{l^2}{6} m_1 \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{l}{2} m_1 \dot{z} \dot{\theta} \cos\theta - \frac{l}{2} m_1 g \cos\theta
$$
