I gracefully struggled through this simulation during college in a controls course that ended up being one of my favorite classes. Controls theory and the possibilities we are able to achieve are fascinating. I want to give a quick shout out to the following public resource which was the principal material we studied in that class and where a lot of my code comes from. The github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/byu-controlbook/controlbook_public). I also want to shout out my professor Dr. Killpack who did a phenomenal job instilling a continous curiosity in engineering and especially in controls. Throughout this post I will assume you have some knowledge with **Euler-Lagrange Equations**, **Python**, **Linear Algebra** and **ODE's**.

The system above has two degrees of freedom, so our generalized coordinates will be: **$q_1 = \theta$ and $q_2 = z$**  
There are two bodies, so we'll have 2 equations of motion. Let's start by writing the position vectors to the center of mass of each body.

Modeling the pendulum as a slender arm (1) and the cart as a solid body (2) we get:

$$
\vec{r}_1 = (z + \frac{l}{2}\sin\theta)\hat{i} + \frac{l}{2}\cos\theta\hat{j}
$$

$$
\vec{r}_2 = z\hat{i}
$$

Take the derivative of both to get:

$$
\dot{\vec{r}_1} = (\dot{z} + \frac{l}{2}\dot{\theta}\cos\theta)\hat{i} - \frac{l}{2}\dot{\theta}\sin\theta\hat{j}
$$

$$
\dot{\vec{r}_2} = \dot{z}\hat{i}
$$
